## Getting Started

If you don't know much about In-App Purchases, you'll find a good introduction
on the subject here: [In-App Purchase Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/).
It's from Apple, but the exact same concepts apply to Android.

You probably want to start by installing the plugin into your project.
This is documented in the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki/Setup)

Once your project is setup properly, add the minimal initialization code in
your project and check that it works. You'll find a [Minimal Example Here](doc/minimal-example.js).

Find a more [Complete Example Here](https://github.com/Fovea/cordova-plugin-purchase-demo).

If you can't get things to work, go through the [Troubleshooting Checklist](doc/troubleshooting.md).

You're all good? Time to read some more documentation. Hooray!
